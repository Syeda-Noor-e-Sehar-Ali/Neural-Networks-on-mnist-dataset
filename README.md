# Neural-Networks-on-mnist-dataset
Training neural networks on the MNIST dataset involves building a multi-layer perceptron or convolutional neural network:

Dataset: MNIST consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), with a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.

Model Architecture: For MNIST, a typical neural network architecture includes input layers corresponding to image dimensions, hidden layers with activation functions like ReLU, and an output layer with softmax activation for classification.

Training: Utilizes backpropagation with optimization techniques like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize classification error.

Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy or cross-entropy loss measure the model's ability to correctly classify unseen test data.

Applications: Successfully trained models on MNIST demonstrate foundational skills in image recognition and classification, serving as a benchmark for evaluating new neural network architectures and techniques.
